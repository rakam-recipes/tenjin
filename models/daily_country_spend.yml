      description: Includes pre-install metrics(such as imps, clicks, installs, and spend) by date, campaign, and country. “spend” is spend amount converted to USD, and “original_spend” is spend amount in “original_currency”. The model doesn't contain all the spend of daily_spend because some ad-networks don’t have spend by country breakdown.
